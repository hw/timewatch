TimeWatch for BlackBerry

Own an automatic/manual watch and need to adjust the time on your watch?
TimeWatch is designed with two features to help:

1) Second hand display with minute chime to let you know the start of a new minute in time.
Adjust the second hand on your watch to 12 o'clock position and set it at the chime signal.

2) Time marker function to measure your watch's drift.
Activate the menu and press the 'Mark Time' menu item when your watch's second hand is at the 12 o'clock position.
